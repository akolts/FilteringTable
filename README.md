FilteringTable
==============

FilterTable is an extension of the Table component in Vaadin. FilterTable is available for Vaadin 6, Vaadin 7 (versions postfixed with '.v7') and Vaadin 8 (versions postfixed with '.v8'). 

##### Added features: 
* Provides automatically generated filter components between the table header and body 
* Automatically filters enum, boolean and date properties 
* Other properties are filtered as a string 
* Numeric properties can optionally be filtered with a comparator popup 
* Allows developer to provide own filter implementation for any property 
* Allows developer to decorate the numeric, date, enum and boolean filter components with custom captions and icons 
* Provides integration of PagedTable add-on with the filter bar 
* Provides integration of TreeTable with the filter bar 

## Please always use the latest version of FilteringTable add-on. Bugfixes will only be done for the latest versions of each branch, and the Vaadin 8 version has priority. The Vaadin 6 version will no longer receive any fixes.

A big thanks goes to the numerous contributors providing ideas, bug fixes and new features for FilteringTable.
